**Installing a display language even it is home single language:**

    1- Visiting https://uupdump.ml/

    2- Searching for keywords of your Win10 build. For example, System Information showed my Win10 was at version 10.0.18363, build 18363, so I entered "18363 amd64"

    3- Clicking on a Cumulative update of your build in the search results

    4- In Search files, search for "languagepack"

    5- Downloading the .esd file of the language pack you wish to use

    6- Converting the .esd file into a .cab file. 
_You can use this tool for example https://github.com/abbodi1406/WHD/blob/master/scripts/ESD2CAB-CAB2ESD.zip .
It has a readme explaining how to use it_
